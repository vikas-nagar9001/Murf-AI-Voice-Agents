# AI Voice Agents Challenge - Starter Repository

Welcome to the **AI Voice Agents Challenge** by [murf.ai](https://murf.ai)!

## About the Challenge

We just launched **Murf Falcon** – the consistently fastest TTS API, and you're going to be among the first to test it out in ways never thought before!

**Build 10 AI Voice Agents over the course of 10 Days** along with help from our devs and the community champs, and win rewards!

### How It Works

- One task to be provided everyday along with a GitHub repo for reference
- Build a voice agent with specific personas and skills
- Post on GitHub and share with the world on LinkedIn!

## Repository Structure

This is a **monorepo** that contains both the backend and frontend for building voice agent applications. It's designed to be your starting point for each day's challenge task.

```
falcon-tdova-nov25-livekit/
├── backend/          # LiveKit Agents backend with Murf Falcon TTS
├── frontend/         # React/Next.js frontend for voice interaction
├── start_app.sh      # Convenience script to start all services
└── README.md         # This file
```

### Backend

The backend is based on [LiveKit's agent-starter-python](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-python) with modifications to integrate **Murf Falcon TTS** for ultra-fast, high-quality voice synthesis.

**Features:**

- Complete voice AI agent framework using LiveKit Agents
- Murf Falcon TTS integration for fastest text-to-speech
- LiveKit Turn Detector for contextually-aware speaker detection
- Background voice cancellation
- Integrated metrics and logging
- Complete test suite with evaluation framework
- Production-ready Dockerfile

[→ Backend Documentation](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

The frontend is based on [LiveKit's agent-starter-react](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-react), providing a modern, beautiful UI for interacting with your voice agents.

**Features:**

- Real-time voice interaction with LiveKit Agents
- Camera video streaming support
- Screen sharing capabilities
- Audio visualization and level monitoring
- Light/dark theme switching
- Highly customizable branding and UI

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9+ with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- Node.js 18+ with pnpm
- [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cli/cli-setup) (optional but recommended)
- [LiveKit Server](https://docs.livekit.io/home/self-hosting/local/) for local development

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd falcon-tdova-nov25-livekit
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Copy environment file and configure
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your credentials:
# - LIVEKIT_URL
# - LIVEKIT_API_KEY
# - LIVEKIT_API_SECRET
# - MURF_API_KEY (for Falcon TTS)
# - GOOGLE_API_KEY (for Gemini LLM)
# - DEEPGRAM_API_KEY (for Deepgram STT)

# Download required models
uv run python src/agent.py download-files
```

For LiveKit Cloud users, you can automatically populate credentials:

```bash
lk cloud auth
lk app env -w -d .env.local
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy environment file and configure
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with the same LiveKit credentials
```

### 4. Run the Application

#### Install livekit server

```bash
brew install livekit
```

You have two options:

#### Option A: Use the convenience script (runs everything)

```bash
# From the root directory
chmod +x start_app.sh
./start_app.sh
```

This will start:

- LiveKit Server (in dev mode)
- Backend agent (listening for connections)
- Frontend app (at http://localhost:3000)

#### Option B: Run services individually

```bash
# Terminal 1 - LiveKit Server
livekit-server --dev

# Terminal 2 - Backend Agent
cd backend
uv run python src/agent.py dev

# Terminal 3 - Frontend
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser!

## Daily Challenge Tasks

Each day, you'll receive a new task that builds upon your voice agent. The tasks will help you:

- Implement different personas and conversation styles
- Add custom tools and capabilities
- Integrate with external APIs
- Build domain-specific agents (customer service, tutoring, etc.)
- Optimize performance and user experience

**Stay tuned for daily task announcements!**
